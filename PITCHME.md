# Lightning Talk / Ingite Session

Note:

@ul

* What's it about?
* Where to present it?
* How to write it?
* How to practice it?
* How to present it? 

@ulend

5 things to know:
 
* Idea - info share (how-to - esp. for beginners, here's a cool thing I/someone else made, war story/case study), change minds.
* Where? - int [friday, last-thursday, LOD, away-day], ext [meetup, conf, open spaces - zero work!], type [lightning, session, deep dive, BoF, workshop]
* Write it - There are many ways (blog, post-its, slides, etc.), timings
* Practicing it - say it out loud, go slowly, 
* Doing it - As the room fills up, power stance (standing legs a little apart), mic-tips, go even slower

---

# Conference Session

Note:

* Your voice - styles etc.  Copy people (find heroes), steal. Go to a conference and see how bad some speakers are. 
* Where - submissions (and whats it like behind the curtain) - selling, spelling, videos (chicken-and-egg),
* Write it - speaker submission support, how? (blog, post-its, slides, etc), structure (keep it simple, make it explicit, ensure it flows. Beginning/Middle/End), diagrams/images (inc. licence and attribution), Code, demos
* Practicing it - practice in front of people, watch videos of yourself, get feedback early
* Doing it - case the joint, stand in the space, disasters and back up plans, Pre-talk nerves (inc. being up against/after someone famous)

---

# Deep Dive

Note:

* Your voice - emphasise it, keep it authentic
* Where? - Where to submit to? Conference season.
* Write it - Your title, Your abstract, Other supporting information, More info from behind the curtain, Font size, Accessibility, tools (Gitpitch, Google Slides, PowerPoint / Keynote, Templates, Mind maps / index cards), Co-presenting.
* Practicing it - get feedback even earlier 
* Doing it - speaker dinners / networking, clickers (getting the best recording), social media (twitter, linkedin, youtube, blogs), Q&A, sharing the slides afterwards

---

# Workshop

Note:

* Write it - doing talks again and again, co-presenting deeper dive, more complicated structures and styles (less/no words, no slides, no notes), types (Humorous/Call to Action/Socratic/Story/Story after Story/Marc Anthony)
* Doing it - moving around
